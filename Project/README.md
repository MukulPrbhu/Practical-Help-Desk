## 🏆 Capstone Project: Windows Active Directory Lab

For my final project, I built a small enterprise-style environment using **Windows Server 2022** and a Windows 11 client VM.  

### 🔹 What I Did
- Set up a Windows Server as a **Domain Controller** with Active Directory Domain Services.  
- Configured **static IP addressing** and DNS for both server and client.  
- Joined a Windows client machine to the domain.  
- Created and managed **domain users, groups, and organizational units (OUs)**.  
- Applied and tested **Group Policies** to control security and user access.  
- Explored **password policies** and authentication logs to simulate real IT support tasks.
- Password reset for users  

### 🔹 Key Skills Gained
- Hands-on experience with **Active Directory** in a lab environment.  
- Practical understanding of **user management, authentication, and permissions**.  
- Troubleshooting and configuring **Windows networking and DNS**.  
- Applying **security policies** and managing group-based access.  

This project closely mirrored tasks I would encounter in a real help desk or junior sysadmin role, giving me confidence in supporting enterprise environments.

## Related Studies

Apart from the AD project, I have also delved into the following:

## 🐧 Linux
- Basic commands: `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`, `man`, `touch`, `mkdir`.  
- User management (`adduser`, `passwd --expire`, `addgrp`, `usermod`).  
- File permissions with `chmod`, `chown`, `chgrp`.  
- Package management: `apt update`, `apt upgrade`, `apt remove`.  
- Cron jobs for scheduling tasks (`crontab -e`, logs in `/var/log/syslog`).  
- Security best practices: use `sudo` instead of staying as root.

## 🌐 Networking
- IP configuration and troubleshooting (`ipconfig`, `ifconfig`).  
- DHCP commands (`ipconfig /release`, `/renew`).  
- DNS troubleshooting (`flushdns`, `displaydns`, `registerdns`).  
- Tools: `nslookup`, `netstat`, `traceroute`, `arp`, `ping`.  
- SOHO router concepts.  
- VPN practice with Oracle Free Cloud.

## 🔑 SSH
- Password-based setup: enabling `openssh-server`, firewall (`ufw`) configuration.  
- Key-pair authentication: generating keys, copying `.pub` to `authorized_keys`.  
- Secure login via `ssh user@ip_address`.
