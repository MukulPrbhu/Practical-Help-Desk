## ðŸ“˜ About This Course

I completed a practical IT fundamentals course designed to prepare me for entry-level Help Desk and IT support roles. Through hands-on labs, I gained real-world experience with computer hardware, operating systems, networking, and remote support.  

I learned how modern computers work at a low level, how to troubleshoot and repair desktops and laptops, and how to install, configure, and administer both Windows and Linux systems. I also practiced virtualization, ticketing systems, and essential IT security practices.  

The course wrapped up with a capstone project where I set up and administered a Windows Active Directory domain, hosting Peppermint using docker, an open source ticketing system and simulating a real enterprise environment.
